# Multi Producer / Multi Consumer

This example demonstrates the case where we have multiple message producers and multiple message consumers.

This is very similar to the [multi_producer_single_consumer](../multi_producer_single_consumer/) case, using a separate `WaitGroup` to apply the same idea to the consumers.
